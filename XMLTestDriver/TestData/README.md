#Naming convention for XML web tests:

* This directory must be named "TestFiles"
* There is one configuration file, ConfigTest.xml, which hosts information common to all tests.
* There may be multiple test files, each of the pattern "Test*.xml"; I.e., prefixed with "Test".

The TestDriver console application depends upon these names.
